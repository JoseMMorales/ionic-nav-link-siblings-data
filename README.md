## Ion-nav-project

Nav is a standalone component for loading arbitrary components and pushing new components on to the stack. Unlike Router Outlet, Nav is not tied to a particular router. This means that if we load a Nav component, and push other components to the stack, they will not affect the app's overall router. In this project NavLink is been used as a simplified API when interacting with Nav, where additional components have been customized passing data between reactive forms when moving forward though the application.
